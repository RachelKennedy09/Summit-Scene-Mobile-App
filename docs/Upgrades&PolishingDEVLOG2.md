## 📅 Sprint #9 Polishing (November 27)

### HubScreen.js Polish

#### Sprint Goals

1. Add Hero Section
2. Create Pill Buttons component
3. Create town modal selecter
4. Create category modal selecter
5. hook pills to existing filters
6. add date pill and logic

### Event Polish

1. Add event end time to event model
2. add fresh styling to event cards
3. Business users = "My Past Events" \*\*\*PLEASE NOTE: for development and grading purposes, I left the date handling to be able to choose a PAST date, so you can see the "My past events" feature. Otherwise I would add error handling so people couldnt post an event on a already past date.
4. Local users = Past events completely removed from Event Hub
5. Better handling on the "Date Picker" on PostEventScreen so people can choose todays date easier, and click confirm/cancel for easier handling
6. Better handling on the "Time Picker" on PostEventScreen so people can choose start and end times easier, and click confirm/cancel for easier handling
7. Edit "EditEventScreen" after making changes to PostEventScreen

### Account Polish

1. Add token key so user doesnt get logged out/memory loss when rloading the application
2. Add " Youre logged in as a business/local user"
3. Add "Hello, ${NAME}, Welcome to your summit scene hub

### Map Polish

1. Add Town, Category, Date pills like HubScreen
2. Zoom effect when choosing a town on map

### Community Polish

1. Town filter pills with a modal
2. Summary line after choosing town
3. Show an identity to the posts (Who posted)
