1. Beggining of app h aving troubles with getting tabs on the app without errors. Tried to organize screens right off the bat and keep out of App.js but kept getting errors. I had Co -pilot navigate and do the files myself and some how fixed the errors after fighting with it for a long time.??
2. In my proposal I said I would use ticketmaster API possibly. Summit Scene is different because it targets small towns, bigger APIs don't do that. So I stuck with my own API and researched my own data of REAL events coming up in Banff, Lake Louise, Canmore that only i could research.
3. Most real apps start this way behind the scenes:

   a content team or admin panel where humans add stuff,
   a database,
   an API that serves it to users.

I am just doing the same, solo:

I am the content team.
MongoDB = database.
Express API = backend.
Expo app = frontend client.



- challenge: I thought I should put all files into an app folder and then all into a server folder, but it caused a lot of errors and was going into unknown territory. I later learned the way I had it was correct and still a normal way to build an app.
- - wasnt as organized with my commits as I usually am. files were a bit mixxed together when commiting

- used modern ES module for server side. 

using thunderclient for db testing easier to use than postman and right at my fingertips.

- early on in my projectonce i got to backend, the hubscreen file was already at 400 lines of code, i started seperating into components right away. I am gglad for this as now it is a habbit at the beginning instead of the end. (Thank you to my professor)
